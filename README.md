# BACE1 Inhibitor Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks

![Alt text](images/img1.png = 250x250)

This project focuses on predicting the pIC50 values for beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitors, an important target for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery. Molecules with reported IC50 values were sourced from the ChEMBL database, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Various machine learning (ML) models, including traditional regression techniques and deep neural networks, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), were developed to predict pIC50. Additionally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was built to allow users to input SMILES and receive predicted pIC50 values.
